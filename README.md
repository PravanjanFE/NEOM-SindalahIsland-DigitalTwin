# 🏝️ NEOM Sindalah Island – Digital Twin

A **digital twin of NEOM Sindalah Island** was created in **Unreal Engine**, designed with **3D accuracy** to replicate the **physical island and its luxury infrastructure**.  

This platform allows **tourists to virtually explore Sindalah**, interact with **digital surrogates**, and bridge the gap between **physical tourism and digital experiences**.  

What if travelers could **walk through Sindalah’s marinas, hotels, and beaches virtually** before ever setting foot on the island?  
What if their **digital journeys rewarded them with real perks**, making the virtual experience a **seamless extension of their physical visit**?  

This project combines **BIM-to-3D workflows**, **Unreal Engine environment design**, and **interactive features** to create a **globally accessible tourism twin**.
